MovieMaze is a web application that allows users to discover information about movies, including details like now playing, upcoming releases, popular movies, and search for specific titles. The app leverages the TMDB (The Movie Database) API to fetch movie data and provides an intuitive interface for users to explore and learn more about their favorite films.

## Features

- View Now Playing: Browse a list of movies currently playing in theaters.
- Coming This Week: Discover movies scheduled for release in the upcoming week.
- Popular Movies: Explore a selection of popular movies based on user ratings.
- Movie Search: Find specific movies by entering a search term.
- Movie Details: Access detailed information about each movie, including genres, release date, and cast members.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript.
- Sass for CSS preprocessing.
- Vite.js for fast and efficient development.
- Swiper.js for the movie carousel.
- TMDB API for movie data.

## API Key Security

For simplicity purposes, the TMDB API key is not hidden in this version of the app. In a production environment, it is essential to take appropriate measures to secure API keys. One common approach is to implement the API key on the server-side using environment variables to prevent unauthorized access to the TMDB API.
